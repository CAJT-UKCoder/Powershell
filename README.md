# Powershell

All files within this repository must be saved as a .PS1 file, and used within the Exchange Administration Powershell interface (not the standard server powershell interface)

All files are provided as is, and were tested using Exchange 2010 SP3 Rollup 12

They should work on Exchange 2013 but I make no guarantee for this.
